On 1/21/25, I helped my teammates get their environments set up for the game engine. This took 30 to 45 minutes.

Things I helped them with:
- Setting up Vulkan
- setting up other external ibraries like GLFW and GLM
- Setting up mingw
- Pulling the repo from Github and setting up Github
- Going over the proposal and explaining to them how the project works.
- Setting up CMake

I also gave them designated folders to track non-programming progress.
