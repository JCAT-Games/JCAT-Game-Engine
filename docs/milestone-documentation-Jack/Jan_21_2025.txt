Today I dowloaded GitHubDesktop, Vulcan, and CMake, as well as downloaded the provided zip files. 
I also set up my VSCode envirnment. I also downloaded the compiler used for this project. I also looked through 
a tuturial on how to use Vulcan. This took 1.5 hours to download all of the necessary components.
