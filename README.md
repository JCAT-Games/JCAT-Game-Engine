JCAT Game engine is a project where we build a game engine from scratch using
Vulkan and C/C++. We started this project because we wanted to learn how low level graphics
programming works and wanted to learn the process of how a game is created from the
primitive level. The goal by the end of this semester is to have a functional game engine that we
could use to develop a game with. We also want to be able to have a deep understanding of
how the game engine works.
